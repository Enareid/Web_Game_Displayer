# WebGame Displayer For Railroad Ink

This repository contains a web client to play railroad ink. It allows a client to be connected to a game and play without having to send any commands directly to the reflector.

```Bash
npm install
```
If you have nodemon
```Bash
nodemon

Be sure to have the reflector started at the same ip address, then the one printed by th server, but on the port 3000.
